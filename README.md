Arbiter
===============

Arbiter is a mobile app that lets you build a map to use for situational awareness and geospatial data collection. Once you download your maps and map layers, Arbiter lets you edit offline (no network or wifi connection).  When you have connectivity through either 3G or 4G cellular network, or wifi, you can sync your map layers with the server and youâ€™ll receive updates made by others as well.  Arbiter lets you edit geometries and attributes for points and attributes for polygons and polylines.  It also lets you associate photos (using your device's camera) to features.

##Details

Arbiter has been developed for Android smart phones and tablets. It works best on Android 4.3 and higher
