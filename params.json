Once you download your maps and map layers, Arbiter lets you edit offline (without cell network or wifi connection).  When you have connectivity through 3G or 4G cellular network, or through wifi, you can sync your edits with the server and youâ€™ll receive updates made by others as well.  Arbiter lets you edit geometries and attributes for points, lines, and polygons.  It also lets you associate photos (using your device's camera) to features.\r\n\r\nArbiter has been developed for Android smart phones and tablets. It works best on Android 4.3 and higher\r\n\r\n[Download the latest build and try it out!](http://goo.gl/U2GlPe)\r\n","google":"UA-48332081-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
